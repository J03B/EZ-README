# Challenge 9 - Node.js: EZPZ README Generator

## Final Deployment

Although there is no deployed webpage, this project is deployed in the terminal. 
[Joe Black's EZ README generator](https://github.com/J03B/EZ-README/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a personal README file generator to easily create them as I begin working on new projects in the future. 

### Mock Up

### Task Completed
The task here was to complete a project that would create high-quality files, generated with as little input as possible. Autonomy is essential to become a proficient developer, and saving time from writing README files would aid in those efforts. This challenge should set myself up for furure success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, meeting certain acceptance criteria with Node.js. The criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section. 

#### Exceeding Expectations
To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, we were given starter code that contained a few minor details that didn't follow best practices, and really could slide elsewhere, but I fixed them to ensure everything functions as perfectly as possible. I clean up, organize, and consolidate code, while giving it a neat amount of white space, organizing files and contents to follow best practices, and include comments before each major section of code.

## Instructions
### Testing the deployed site
To test this project, download the repository and open the file location in terminal. For example, if it were to save to your computer's downloads folder, '~/Downloads', at that location in the terminal, enter the repository with 'cd EZ-README/', then enter 'node index.js'. At that point, answer the series of prompts and watch your README easily come to life in the folder with the date and time you ran the application. 

### User Story and Acceptance Criteria

#### User Story
```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

```
